**Title**: Prediction of Loan Default.<br />

**Description**: Building predictive model to predict customers whom will default based personal and historical data of the applicants.<br />

**Objective**: Develop machine learning model to predict defaulters, by creating publishable and reproducible code and report.<br />

**Structure**:<br />
   1- EDA: Read and Clean Data - statistical summary - Visualization - Univariate Analysis - Bivariate Analysis. <br />
   2- Data Preparation: Transformations - Encoding - Splitting data set into training and testing sets. <br />
   3- Model selection: <br />
	- Perform different classification models (default settings). <br />
	- Metrix: Recall - F1 as main metrics. <br />
	- Tuning Models using grad cross validation. <br />
	- Oversampling the train set to address the imbalance target issue. <br />
	- Choose the best model. <br />
	- Creating final report. <br />
