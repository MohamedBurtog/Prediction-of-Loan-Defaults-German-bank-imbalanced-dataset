Title: Prediction of Loan Default

Description: Building predictive model to predict customers whom will default based personal and historical data of the applicants.

Objective: Develop machine learning model to predict defaulters, by creating publishable and reproducible code and report.

Structure:
   1- EDA: Read and Clean Data - statistical summary - Visualization - Univariate Analysis - Bivariate Analysis.
   2- Data Preparation: Transformations - Encoding - Splitting data set into training and testing sets.
   3- Model selection: 
	- Perform different classification models (default settings)
	- Metrix: Recall - F1 as main metrics 
	- Tuning Models using grad cross validation
	- Oversampling the train set to address the imbalance target issue
	- Choose the best model 
	- Creating final report 

File:
   1- ipynb file: contains the python code to reproduce the project
   2- HTML file: code file save in HTML format
   3- pdf file: final report of this project, produced from the ipynb above
   4- README file: contains briefly introduction of the project and how it's organized.
